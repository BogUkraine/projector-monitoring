# projector-monitoring
Homework 1.3 for Projector Highload Software Architecture course
<br>
Configs are taken from https://github.com/bcremer/docker-telegraf-influx-grafana-stack
<br>
Plugin for docker is taken from https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/plugins/inputs/docker/README.md

# How to run the app
1. Copy ./backend/.env.example into ./backend/.env
2. docker-compose up

# Which services are here
1. Telegraf to collect metrics and put them to InfluxDB
2. InfluxDB to store metrics data from Telegraf
3. Grafana to visualize metrics on the dashboards
4. Node.js application (using Nest.js framework) that has:
    * POST /messages endpoint to post a message with any text and store it to MongoDb and ElasticSearch
    * GET /messages/search?search="" to search for a specific message relying on ElasticSearch
    * users model and CRUD
    * message CRUD
5. MongoDB to store the data from the backend
6. ElasticSearch cluster (3 nodes) to store the data and search in text
7. Nginx as a gateway for the backend

# Metrics comparison with and w/o load
You can find a better resolution screens in `./results` folder.

The first pick is after 100.000 request. The next wave is 1.000.000 requests with bigger concurrency
